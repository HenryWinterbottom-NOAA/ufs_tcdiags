Applications Configuration
==========================

The interfaces for the respective applications are defined by YAML
attributes. A pseudo-example of a configuration file is as follows.

.. code-block:: bash


Plotting
========

Plotting can be performed, from the driver application at runtime
using the ``-plot`` option. The plotting capabilities are established
using `matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_ and
`basemap <https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap>`_. Note that `cartopy
<https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy>`_ will be introduced in a future
release.

.. code-block:: bash
